ABOUT GAME

Pac-Man[a] is a maze arcade game developed and released by Namco 
in 1980. The original Japanese title of Puck Man was changed to 
Pac-Man for international releases as a preventative measure
against defacement of the arcade machines.[7] Outside Japan, the
game was published by Midway  Games as part of its licensing 
agreement with Namco America. The player controls Pac-Man, who must
eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four 
colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets 
causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus
points. It is the first game to run on the Namco Pac-Man arcade board.
